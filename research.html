                            Traditional plastic waste handling involves the full life cycle of plastics, starting from
                            crude oil extraction and manufacturing into pellets, followed by consumption and,
                            eventually, disposal or recycling.<br> Challenges include spillage, environmental pollution,
                            and
                            harm to ecosystems. Addressing these issues requires sustainable practices like reducing
                            consumption, improving recycling, and exploring alternative materials to mitigate
                            environmental impact and promote a circular economy.<br> Therefore a gap exists to be
                            exploited to mitigate these problems which is the focus of our proposed plastic waste
                            handling methods.

                            <strong>This research focused on the development of a bioreactor system for treatment of

                                sewage for enhanced agricultural production.</strong> This entailed characterization
                            of
                            the effluent
                            from wastewater treatment plants, development of a bioreactor system utilizing waste
                            plastic
                            materials and use the parametrically optimized biofilters to treat the waste water.
                            Piloting
                            of the system in a kitchen garden scale irrigation project will be done with potential
                            evaluation of its sustainability in upscaling of the processed water for large scale
                            agricultural use

                            The researcher has established a research team named<strong> MAMReT</strong> to effect
                            research in the areas
                            of Materials Engineering, Additive Manufacturing, Recycling of plastic waste, and
                            Computational modelling of energy materials. The goal is to establish a laboratory based
                            research system where peer learning will be cultivated from the lowest level (BSc to
                            PhD)
